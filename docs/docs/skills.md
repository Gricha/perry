# Skills

Perry includes an Agent Skill you can use to onboard assistants to Perry workflows.

The skill is concise and command-focused with expected behavior and gotchas. It covers:

- Installing and running the Perry agent
- Creating and connecting to workspaces over your tailnet
- OpenCode attach flow over `http://<workspace>:4096`
- Claude Code usage inside workspace shells
- SSH access and key syncing
- Common commands and troubleshooting

If you are using a skills system that supports Agent Skills, load the file directly from the repo.
