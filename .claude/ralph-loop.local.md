Ultrathink. Familiarize yourself with the codebase to understand what this project does. You can look at DESIGN.md, AGENTS.md and spelunk around the code. Once you are there - take a single task from TODO.md and implement it. Make sure to follow task description, think of maintainable, simple code, make sure it is reasonably tested - if its UI, you can use playwright to make sure we aren't breaking anything, and run a fun validation loop at the end (there is validate script). Once that's done, create a PR, check the status of PR periodically - if all the checks pass, you can merge it. Take up another task in the meantime while waiting for PR to pass. If there's feedback from Sentry review - read it and adapt it if it makes sense. If and only if the TODO has no remaining tasks you may output <promise>COMPLETED</promise>
