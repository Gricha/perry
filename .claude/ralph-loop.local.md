Your goal is to implement the next thing from the TODO list. Make sure that validate passes. Follow AGENTS.md guideline around tests and if tests should be added, make sure they are passing. If there are no more left TODO tasks, don't pick up new work, but output <promise>COMPLETED</promise>. if you think we need to add a follow up item, you can do it in considerations but those aren't tasks. Only do that if you really think something important and big is to be followed up on. For simple considerations and fixes, you are good. Follow the plan and the design doc in DESIGN.md
